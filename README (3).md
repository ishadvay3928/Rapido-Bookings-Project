The analysis leverages SQL for querying and filtering the data , while a Power BI dashboard visualizes the insights through interactive charts and graphs.

## Objectives

- Analyze successful and canceled bookings.
- Identify average ride distances by vehicle type.
- Highlight top customers based on booking frequency.
- Examine cancellation reasons categorized by customers and drivers.
- Visualize booking trends and key metrics using a dynamic dashboard.

## Technologies Used

- SQL: Data querying , filtering and Sorting.
- Power BI: Interactive visualization and dashboard creation.
